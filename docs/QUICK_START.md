## 🚀 What is SolanaLotto?

SolanaLotto is a decentralized lottery protocol that creates **predictable windows of positive expected value (+EV)** for players. Unlike traditional lotteries where the house always wins, SolanaLotto's rolldown mechanism allows sophisticated players to profit during specific market conditions.

### The Core Innovation

SolanaLotto uses a **probabilistic rolldown system**:

| Cap | Threshold | What Happens |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| **Soft Cap** | $1.75M | Probabilistic rolldown trigger possible each draw |
| **Hard Cap** | $2.25M | 100% of jackpot distributes (forced rolldown) |

Between $1.75M and $2.25M, each draw has a chance to trigger rolldown:
- Probability = (Jackpot - $1.75M) / ($2.25M - $1.75M)
- Increases linearly as jackpot grows
- At hard cap, probability = 100% (forced rolldown)

During full rolldown events:

- **Ticket Cost:** $2.50
- **Expected Value:** ~$4.06
- **Player Edge:** +62.4%

This isn't a bug—it's the core feature that drives engagement and volume.

### Dynamic House Fee

Fees scale with jackpot excitement:

| Jackpot Level | House Fee |
|---------------|-----------|
| < $500k | 28% |
| $500k - $1M | 32% |
| $1M - $1.5M | 36% |
| > $1.5M | 40% |
| Rolldown | 28% |

## 🧠 For Sophisticated Players (The Exploit)

### Understanding the Rolldown

1. **Monitor Jackpot:** Watch as it grows toward the $1.75M soft cap
2. **Calculate Probability:** Use formula P = (Jackpot - $1.75M) / $0.5M when jackpot ≥ $1.75M
3. **Strategic Buying:** Buy tickets when probability of rolldown justifies expected value
4. **Maximize at Hard Cap:** Buy maximum volume during forced rolldown at $2.25M hard cap
5. **Profit:** Collect winnings from Match 3, 4, and 5 tiers during rolldowns

### Expected Value During Full Rolldown ($2.25M Hard Cap)

| Match | Rolldown Prize | Odds | EV Contribution |
|-------|----------------|------|-----------------|
| 5 | ~$51,000 | 1/39,028 | $1.31 |
| 4 | ~$1,030 | 1/800 | $1.29 |
| 3 | ~$51 | 1/47 | $1.09 |
| 2 | $2.50 | 1/6.8 | $0.37 |
| **Total EV** | | | **$4.06** |

**Edge: $4.06 - $2.50 = +$1.56 per ticket (+62.4%)**

### Probabilistic Rolldown Zone

Between $1.75M and $2.25M, each draw has a chance to trigger full rolldown:
- Probability increases linearly with jackpot size
- Expected value increases as jackpot grows
- Unpredictable timing prevents calendar gaming

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Monitor jackpot growth** as it approaches $1.75M soft cap
2. **Calculate probability** of rolldown using formula: (Jackpot - $1.75M) / $0.5M
3. **Buy tickets when probability is high** for maximum +EV
4. **Buy maximum volume** during forced rolldowns at $2.25M hard cap
5. **Join syndicates** to pool capital and reduce variance
6. **Enter Syndicate Wars** for bonus prize pool (1% of monthly sales)
7. **Collect Lucky Numbers NFTs** for future jackpot bonuses

### Risk Warning

- **Variance exists:** Individual draws can still lose money
- **Volume affects prizes:** More tickets = lower per-winner prizes
- **Timing matters:** If someone hits jackpot, rolldown is cancelled

**This is gambling.** Most players will lose money over time. The rolldown exploit requires:

- Significant capital (recommended $1,000+ for meaningful exploitation)
- Correct timing (monitor soft cap zone and hard cap approach)
- Acceptance of variance (even +EV bets can lose short-term)
- Understanding of the dynamic fee system

Only play with money you can afford to lose. Verify your local laws before participating.
