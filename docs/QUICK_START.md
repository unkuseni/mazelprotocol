# SolanaLotto Quick Start Guide

> **The world's first intentionally exploitable lottery on Solana**

## 🚀 What is SolanaLotto?

SolanaLotto is a decentralized lottery protocol that creates **predictable windows of positive expected value (+EV)** for players. Unlike traditional lotteries where the house always wins, SolanaLotto's rolldown mechanism allows sophisticated players to profit during specific market conditions.

### The Core Innovation

SolanaLotto uses a **probabilistic rolldown system**:

| Cap | Threshold | What Happens |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| **Soft Cap** | $1.75M | Probabilistic rolldown trigger possible each draw |
| **Hard Cap** | $2.25M | 100% of jackpot distributes (forced rolldown) |

Between $1.75M and $2.25M, each draw has a chance to trigger rolldown:
- Probability = (Jackpot - $1.75M) / ($2.25M - $1.75M)
- Increases linearly as jackpot grows
- At hard cap, probability = 100% (forced rolldown)

During full rolldown events:

- **Ticket Cost:** $2.50
- **Expected Value Range:** $2.87 to $5.10 (depends on jackpot level and tickets sold)
- **Player Edge:** +14.8% to +104% (optimal conditions: 475k tickets at hard cap)

This isn't a bug—it's the core feature that drives engagement and volume.

> **🔒 PRIZE TRANSITION SYSTEM:** All prizes START as FIXED amounts during normal mode, then TRANSITION to PARI-MUTUEL (shared pool) during rolldown events and high-volume draws. This hybrid system ensures **operator liability is ALWAYS CAPPED** while maintaining attractive +EV windows for players.

### Dynamic House Fee

Fees scale with jackpot excitement:

| Jackpot Level | House Fee |
|---------------|-----------|
| < $500k | 28% |
| $500k - $1M | 32% |
| $1M - $1.5M | 36% |
| > $1.5M | 40% |
| Rolldown | 28% |

---

### Why Pari-Mutuel Protects the Operator

During rolldown, prizes transition from fixed to pari-mutuel:
- **Total payout = EXACTLY the jackpot amount** (capped liability)
- Whether 500k or 2M tickets are sold, operator pays the same
- Player +EV is preserved through proportional distribution
- No unbounded risk regardless of volume or winner count

### Step 3: Pick Your Numbers

Choose 6 numbers between 1 and 46, or use Quick Pick for random selection.

### Step 4: Buy Tickets

Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Tickets cost $2.50 each.

## 🧠 For Sophisticated Players (The Exploit)

### Understanding the Rolldown

1. **Monitor Jackpot:** Watch as it grows toward the $1.75M soft cap
2. **Calculate Probability:** Use formula P = (Jackpot - $1.75M) / $0.5M when jackpot ≥ $1.75M
3. **Strategic Buying:** Buy tickets when probability of rolldown justifies expected value
4. **Maximize at Hard Cap:** Buy maximum volume during forced rolldown at $2.25M hard cap
5. **Profit:** Collect winnings from Match 3, 4, and 5 tiers during rolldowns

### Expected Value During Full Rolldown ($2.25M Hard Cap) — PARI-MUTUEL

> **🔒 PARI-MUTUEL PRIZES:** During rolldown, all prizes use shared pool distribution. Actual per-winner prizes depend on ticket volume. Estimates below assume ~475k tickets (optimal conditions).

| Match | Pool Share | Est. Prize* | Odds | EV Contribution |
|-------|------------|-------------|------|-----------------|
| 5 | 25% | ~$46,000* | 1/39,028 | $1.18 |
| 4 | 35% | ~$1,330* | 1/800 | $1.66 |
| 3 | 40% | ~$90* | 1/47 | $1.90 |
| 2 | — | $2.50 (fixed) | 1/6.8 | $0.37 |
| **Total EV** | | | | **$5.11** |

*\*Estimated prizes at 475k tickets. Actual = Pool ÷ Winners (pari-mutuel). More tickets = lower per-winner prizes.*

**Edge: $5.11 - $2.50 = +$2.61 per ticket (+104%)**

**At higher volume (700k tickets):** EV drops to ~$2.87 (+14.8% edge) — pari-mutuel naturally adjusts!

### Probabilistic Rolldown Zone

Between $1.75M and $2.25M, each draw has a chance to trigger full rolldown:
- Probability increases linearly with jackpot size
- Expected value increases as jackpot grows
- Unpredictable timing prevents calendar gaming

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Monitor jackpot growth** as it approaches $1.75M soft cap
2. **Calculate probability** of rolldown using formula: (Jackpot - $1.75M) / $0.5M
3. **Buy tickets when probability is high** for maximum +EV
4. **Buy maximum volume** during forced rolldowns at $2.25M hard cap
5. **Join syndicates** to pool capital and reduce variance
6. **Enter Syndicate Wars** for bonus prize pool (1% of monthly sales)
7. **Collect Lucky Numbers NFTs** for future jackpot bonuses *(coming soon — not yet implemented)*

### Risk Warning

- **Variance exists:** Individual draws can still lose money
- **Volume affects prizes:** More tickets = lower per-winner prizes
- **Timing matters:** If someone hits jackpot, rolldown is cancelled

## 💻 For Developers

### Installation

> ⚠️ **SDK NOT YET PUBLISHED** — The `@solanalotto/sdk` NPM package does not exist yet. The examples below show the intended API design. For now, interact with the on-chain programs directly via Anchor's generated client or the IDL.

```bash
# Coming soon:
# npm install @solanalotto/sdk

# For now, use Anchor directly:
npm install @coral-xyz/anchor @solana/web3.js @solana/spl-token
```

### Quick Example (using Anchor directly)

```typescript
import { Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { Program, AnchorProvider } from '@coral-xyz/anchor';
import { IDL } from './idl/solana_lotto'; // Generated by `anchor build`

const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {});
const program = new Program(IDL, PROGRAM_ID, provider);

// Get current state
const [lotteryState] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("lottery")], program.programId
);
const state = await program.account.lotteryState.fetch(lotteryState);
console.log('Jackpot:', state.jackpotBalance.toNumber() / 1e6, 'USDC');

// Buy ticket
await program.methods
  .buyTicket({ numbers: [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42], useFreeTicket: false })
  .accounts({ /* ... required accounts */ })
  .rpc();
```

### Key Instructions

```typescript
// On-chain program instructions (via Anchor client):

// Tickets
program.methods.buyTicket(params)          // Single ticket
program.methods.buyBulk(params)            // Up to 50 tickets

// Claims
program.methods.claimPrize()               // Single ticket
program.methods.claimBulkPrize(params)     // One from bulk
program.methods.claimAllBulkPrizes()       // All from bulk

// Syndicates
program.methods.createSyndicate(params)
program.methods.joinSyndicate(params)
program.methods.leaveSyndicate()
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This is gambling.** Most players will lose money over time. The rolldown exploit requires:

- Significant capital (recommended $1,000+ for meaningful exploitation)
- Correct timing (monitor soft cap zone and hard cap approach)
- Acceptance of variance (even +EV bets can lose short-term)
- Understanding of the dynamic fee system

Only play with money you can afford to lose. Verify your local laws before participating.
