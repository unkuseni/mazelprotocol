### ⚠️ Partially Implemented

| Feature | Specification | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Streak Bonuses | SOLANA_LOTTO.md | `update_streak()` tracks streaks; `get_streak_bonus_bps()` computes bonus | Bonus is **never applied** in any prize calculation or ticket purchase |
| MEV Protection | ADVANCED_FEATURES.md §4 | Slot window tightened to 10 slots (~4s) on randomness reveal | No Jito tip integration; no threshold encryption |

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented (Design Only)

| Feature | Specification | What Exists in Code | What's Missing |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Lucky Numbers NFT | ADVANCED_FEATURES.md §3 | Data structure (`LuckyNumbersNFT`), constants, events, error codes | **No instructions** — cannot mint, claim bonuses, or govern NFTs |
| Threshold Encryption MEV | ADVANCED_FEATURES.md §4.2-4.3 | Nothing | Entire feature — encrypted tickets, key management, decryption |
| Jito Integration | ADVANCED_FEATURES.md §4.4 | Nothing | Jito tip accounts, bundle integration |
| SDK (`@mazelprotocol/sdk`) | QUICK_START.md, SOLANA_LOTTO.md | Nothing | No NPM package exists; API examples in docs are aspirational |
| Governance DAO | WHITEPAPER.md §6.1 | Nothing | No on-chain governance — authority is a single signer |
| White-label / Cross-chain / DAO Transition | Roadmap | Nothing | Future roadmap items |

### 🗑️ Removed Features (Documented as Removed)

| Feature | Previously In | Removal Note |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Mega Events | ADVANCED_FEATURES.md | Removed in v2.5 |
| $LOTTO Token & Staking | WHITEPAPER.md, TECHNICAL_SPEC.md | Removed in v2.3 |
| Second Chance Draws | TECHNICAL_SPEC.md | Removed in v2.2 (struct reference cleaned up in v3.0) |

> **🔒 CRITICAL DESIGN FEATURE:** All prizes START as FIXED amounts during normal operation, then TRANSITION to PARI-MUTUEL (shared pool) during rolldown events and high-volume draws. This hybrid system ensures **operator liability is ALWAYS CAPPED** while maintaining attractive +EV windows for players.

> **🛡️ INSURANCE SYSTEM:** 2% of every ticket sale goes to an insurance pool that can be used during insolvency emergencies. Combined with the 3% reserve fund, this provides **5% total buffer** for prize pool shortfalls. Emergency fund transfers require authority approval with audit logging.
